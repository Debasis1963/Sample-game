 # Sample-game
 
 #Help required
 
This code example shows how to use a timer, mouse input, keyboard input, and other elements of a simple game. The example also shows how to use the state design pattern for the three states in the game, the introduction screen, the game, and the game over screen. This complicates the code somewhat, but makes it much easier to add states to the game.  It is not really a game, more of a sketch for a game architecture.
